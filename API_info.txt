This API requires Node.js, NPM, and Express framework to be installed. 

When the server is started, immediately atttempts to request the game data from the
provided WillowTree URL.

The API is broken into two main HTTP rest calls for:
1. Sending the data for a new game - /newGame
2. Making a guess on the provided headshots and names - /guess

1. New Game
This call returns back the game data which can be used for a new game
based upon the mode. For future game mode expandability, only an addition
case needs to be added to the switch(mode) statement. The game data is returned
in a JSON Object. Only the required data (headshot, name, etc) to make the game run is returned.

2. Guess
When making a guess, either on a headshot or a name, the guess profile
has an id associated with the guess. This guess checked against the first and last name
provided from the client for a match with the id.
